## password and secrets - sending tools

[read2burn.com](https://www.read2burn.com/)
transport passwords more secure by email
Sending secrets by email has some problems. First, the email is sent in clear text, everybody who can read the transmission can read the secret, second the email is stored in the email account of the sender and the recipient! read2burn.com enables a secure transmission by storing the secret encrypted and creating an access url that is valid only once. Therefore a manipulation by others will be recognized.
