Written entirely in Standard C++ and OpenGL, it runs on all Windows platforms, OSX, GNU/Linux, IRIX, Solaris, HP-Ux, AIX and FreeBSD operating systems. The OpenSceneGraph is now well established as a robust scene graph technology, used widely in the vis-sim, space, scientific, oil-gas, games and virtual reality industries.
