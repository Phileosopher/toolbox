- ux to indicate what is best
- dark patterns w/ steering
- how it slowly sways public opinion and establishes precedent and preference

3 most common mistakes of UI design
by [MDS](https://robhope.com/yo-mds)

1. too many font sizes used. Try to use 1-2 sizes and vary other things like weight, negative space, color, casing.
2. don't over rely on strict mathematical spacing - use optical alignment instead - make judgments based on the needs of the layout.
3. consistent color usage. Tappable = one color. dont make titles and buttons same color. mind accessibility.

Simple Layout checklist
- Clear idea of purpose, target audience, where/how long it will be seen
- Information hierarchy (vary size, contrast, position)
- Clear visual structure - pick the most suitable way to group elements
- Space - leave enough whitespace. Too much > too little
- Alignment - use as few lines as possible

Steve Schoger
[little details of visual ui design](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1206234577821286406?s=20)
