title:  Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

year:   1886

author:

  name: Robert Louis Stevenson

---

=Story of the Door=

Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance, that was

never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in

discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary, and

yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to

his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye;

something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which

spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but

more often and loudly in the acts of his life...
