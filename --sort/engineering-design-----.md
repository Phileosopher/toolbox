## typography tips tools

Establish sizes for a hierarchy H1-H6, links, and body text without using any color. then, apply color/font weight/text decoration/letter spacing etc. to text and links as needed to convey functionality or a certain purpose e.g. I see students underline things that aren't clickable, but it looks like a link

Try to use as few type styles as possible for consistency. Setting up a type system before designing will help. I often see students using 3 different sizes for body copy, 2 different colors for links and 5 heading sizes…your designs will look better and your user will learn how to navigate through your site better if things are consistent!

To set up your type sizes and hierarchy, you can get started with a type scale tool like Modularscale or Typescale

Avoid using display fonts for body copy or things longer than a sentence or two

Left align text longer than a sentence or two for readability.
You shouldn't center paragraph text,
and ["say no to justification on the web"](https://designforhackers.com/blog/justify-text-html-css/)!
Just don't do it.

Body copy should be at least 16px, 18-21px is even better.

Give body copy line-height of 1.2-1.5 at least for legibility. To meet W3C accessibility guidelines "Line height is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs-that's 150%."

Longer line lengths = more line height, short line lengths = less

Headings tend to be larger and bolder than other elements to stand out. A good way to think about type hierarchy is: what needs to stand out most on the page?

Pair a serif with a sans, sans with sans, but be careful with serif and serif unless you know what you're doing and have a vision lol
