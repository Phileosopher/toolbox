The Art Of Clean Code by [Victor Rentea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4OIo4T7I_E)
  * Make it more readable even if it makes writing harder : We read 10x more times than we write
  * Boy scout rule : always check in code cleaner than you found it
  * Functions are verbs
  * Boolean names should always answer yes/no
  * Classes are nouns. Avoid meaningless names (OrderInfo, OrderData vs Order)
  * Delete the interfaces : except for Remoting/API client jars and strategy pattern implementation.
  * Names : Make the name speak for itself. Apply Continuous renaming as your learn the application
  * Names : Names should be at least pronounceable. Don't abbreviate ! Unless it's a basic business concept, like VAT
  * Names : should be consistent and unique (synonyms confuse).
  * Names should have meaningful context. eg: order.customerFirstName. But don't repeat yourself (DRY) : Order.~~order~~CreationDate
  * Functions should be small : 5-10 lines, ... or at least should be understandable in 5 sec no more.
  * Functions do one thing
  * Functions have max 2-3 parameters
