For the US only... Accuweather, along with the vast myriad weather apps, really just uses data provided for free by the Nation Weather Service. Oh sure they have forecasters but no way do they have enough for every county and forecast, most really just give overall forecasts for general areas. Instead of saying, "My app is more accurate," actually go find your local NWS office, and you can find a more specific forecast for your area that will tend to be more accurate overall. And remember, what the NWS literally gives away for free these companies want to monetize and have you pay subscription fees for what already is free weather data...
Edit: got messaged a cool question regarding why your local NWS would be more accurate. A NWS office will have employees from that region who focus not just on synoptic (large scale forecasting) but also local patterns and their affect on weather that you just can not get from a lot of the paid apps. A majority of the apps will literally just take the data from a single weather model. While NWS uses what are called ensembles that give multiple outputs that they can use to not only analyze the agreed upon patterns, but deduce the most likely outcome before making an official forecast. In the immortal words of the great Bill Paxton those apps are ‚Äúin it for the money not the science.‚Äù
